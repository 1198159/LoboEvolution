Version 0.99.3:
------------

Lobo Evolution was born as a fork of LoboBrowser. 
Lobo Evolution continues the work of lobochief (owner LoboBrowser), the first version of Lobo Evolution was 0.98.5 in continuation with the old project.
After three years Lobo Browser has no new commits, the owner has changed but the work has not restarted. 
For these reasons we change the package from org.lobobrowser to org.loboevolution and remove the lobobrowser license from the java classes, 
the XAMJ_Build project is renamed to LoboEvolution_Build, the LoboBrowser license is moved to LoboEvolution_Build/license as a history
