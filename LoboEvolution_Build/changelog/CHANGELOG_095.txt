Version 0.95
------------

- This has our first release of the pure Java HTML

  to render some pages (including our HTML-based site)
  but it still has a number of limitations which will
  be addressed in future versions.
  
- There are some minimal changes to the XAMJ and Clientlet API.
  
- The license was changed from BSD to LGPL.

- Fixed tutorial Update button bug.
