Version 0.98.2
--------------

- Added Scenario-*.jar to platform classpath
  of JavaFX sources.

- Improved caching of compiled Java or JavaFX
  code so that java.lang.Class objects are
  not retained and more compilation results
  can be cached in main memory.
  
- Added sourcelist and classlist directives
  which should be used instead of listing.xml.

- HTML clientlet now checks Content-Language
  header and sets document locales (a new
  Cobra feature) accordingly.
  
- Changed Linux/Unix desktop launcher so it
  runs "java -jar lobo.jar".
  
- Added toString() to URLJavaFileObject, which
  fixes names of source files shown in some
  compiler error messages.
  
- Added warning mechanisms to make it easier
  to discover how to run Lobo from source.
