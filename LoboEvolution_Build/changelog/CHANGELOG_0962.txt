Version 0.96.2 
--------------

- Implemented XMLHttpRequest class for use
  in Javascript. (This is what is often referred
  to as "AJAX"). Currently allows requests
  on any host, but note that this will certainly
  be restricted in future versions.

- Implemented incremental rendering.
  The test tool now uses a simple incremental
  rendering routine as part of the 
  navigate() method.

- Implemented "position" style property.
  Supports absolute, relative and static.
  (Absolute DIV in absolute DIV works;
  rules need to be complied with in other 
  scenarios).
  
- Implemented "z-index" style property.
  (UNTESTED)
    
- Implemented "overflow" style property. 
  It supports values scroll, auto, hide
  and visible.
  
- Replaced top-level JScrollPane with a
  block that has a default property similar
  to "overflow: auto". This in turn fixed
  some problems with JScrollPane layout,
  such as relayout after resizing.
  
- Implemented "float" style property. Works 
  with DIVs, images, and elements that 
  support the "display" property.

- Added means to allow "plugging in" a handler
  for OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET tags. Look
  for HtmlRendererContext.getHtmlObject().
 
- Fixed attributes without an explicit
  value (such as "checked" in radio buttons).

- Implemented "screen" variable of Window.
  
- Changed Window.setTimeout() functionality so 
  timeout events are delivered in GUI thread.
  (UNTESTED)
  
- Fixed issue with Javascript objects wrapping
  Java objects using weak references.
  
- "Fixed" so that TDs that don't have parent
  TRs are also rendered.

- Parser is now aware of SPACER elements, which
  allows Yahoo! home page to render (but the
  page Yahoo! gives Cobra is not the regular
  home page).

- Did some general refactoring of rendering
  code to make it more robust. Fixed many
  known and unknown layout bugs in the process.
