Version 0.92.1 (Development Snapshot):
--------------------------------------

- Switched to developing with Eclipse 3.1.

- Moved XAMJ event classes to package
  org.xamjwg.event, which is now also an
  implicit import.
  
- Events are now based on generics.

- XamjEvaluatable now uses generics as well.

- Fixed some issues with enabling/disabling
  widget hierarchy.

- Fixed so that clicking on a .htln from HTML
  always brings window to front.
  
- Fixed so that progress splash window is
  shown for links clicked from HTML (and in
  general when navigating outside the Warrior
  browser frame.)
