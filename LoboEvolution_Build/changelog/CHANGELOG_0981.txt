Version 0.98.1 (Cobra Only)
---------------------------

- Note: HtmlParser constructors now take
  Document instances as opposed to just 
  HTMLDocument ones.

- Note: Made onContextMenu() callback return 
  a boolean.
  
- Added setLocales() and getLocales() methods
  to HTMLDocumentImpl. The locale is used
  to determine if a font can display text 
  in the locale language. When the document 
  locale is null, the default platform locale 
  is used.

- Provided implementations of getCookie() and
  setCookie() in SimpleUserAgentContext, based
  on the default CookieHandler, if there is one
  available.

- Patch #1916821: Window.setInterval 
  implementation. (Contributed by user
  gwallet).

- Added callback methods in HtmlRendererContext
  for click and doubleclick events.
  
- Added setters for most of the state in
  SimpleUserAgentContext, which means it's not
  necessary to extend it most of the time.
  
- Added AbstractHtmlRendererContext, containing
  blank method implementations.

- In order to comply with the InputSource docs,
  DocumentBuilderImpl now opens a stream from 
  the URI provided, if neither a stream or 
  reader are provided. (Issue noted by Jivko 
  Sabev.)

- Added isImageLoadingEnabled() method to
  HtmlRendererContext.
