Version 0.96.5 (Cobra only)
---------------------------

- Note: Some of the following fixes allow
  the new Google link bar to render. Also,
  Amazon.com rendering is now pretty close,
  with some minor issues remaining.

- Note: We are now using Rhino 1.6R5, which
  is released under a dual MPL/GPL license.

- Fixed ArrayStoreException related to 
  selection listener. (Reported by user
  ulifu).
    
- Implemented innerHTML property and added
  setter for innerText.

- Input type "image" was implemented. (You
  will notice that in the Yahoo! page served
  to Cobra and in the Amazon.com page).

- Fixed so that selection node is not null
  when selection does not include text. 
  (Problem noted by user ulifu).

- Implemented Image class functionality, 
  including onload event.

- Optimized image loading, particularly
  when there are duplicate images.
  
- Fixed some table layout bugs, e.g. DIVs
  nested in a table would expand the table.
  
- Fixed some horizontal alignment issues
  in the presence of floats.

- Added the following methods to HtmlPanel:
  setHtml, hasSelection.

- Fixed parameter type casting from 
  Javascript to Java.

- Fixed bug: Case sensitivity of element 
  name in ID selector in CSS.

- Implemented white-space style property
  and NOWRAP attribute.

- Implemented text-indent style property.

- Implemented media types for LINK, STYLE
  and @import rules.

- Fixed bug: Background image not showing 
  sometimes.

- Added currentStyle property to elements,
  and fixed style property to only include
  local style attribute state.  
  
- Implemented BODY vlink and link attributes,
  provided isVisitedLink() is implemented
  in HtmlRendererContext.

- Modified CSS parser to allow class names
  that start with a number (given that
  YouTube uses such a class name).
  
- Modified CSS parser to allow class names
  with the underscore character. (First
  reported by user dadvir).

- Implemented BODY onload event. (UNTESTED)
  
- Implemented preferred size for HtmlPanel.
  Method setPreferredWidth() must be called
  first. This is useful when the caller needs
  the panel to be sized depending on the 
  HTML content. (Feature requested by user
  kyank).
  
- Implemented element attributes offsetLeft,
  offsetTop, offsetWidth and offsetHeight.
  (A major refactoring of the way RenderState
  is handled was done to implement this).
  
- Changed background color rendering so that
  it matches FireFox behavior.

- Allowing resolution of URLs (e.g. href in
  anchor tags) when the document URL is 
  malformed.

- Fixed issue with text areas and selects
  missing in form parameters.
