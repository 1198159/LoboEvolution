Version 0.97.4
--------------

- Changed to allow META http-equiv elements
  to be placed in HTML tag and not just the
  HEAD tag.

- Optimized checking of META http-equiv
  so that scripts are not processed twice.

- Changed cookie date formats to allow
  2-digit years. (Allows permanent login
  at FreshMeat.)

Cobra changes:

- NOTE: Moved isMedia() method to 
  UserAgentContext so it can be used 
  by parser-only code.

- Fixed so that layout revalidation does
  not cause inputs to be cleared.

- Optimized so that hovering over certain
  elements that do not have a hover
  style declaration does not cause a layout
  revalidation.  

- Fixed so that some styles of images and
  inputs are functional, e.g. border and
  margins.
  
- Implemented image border, hspace and vspace
  attributes.

- Fixed Javascript scoping issue that was
  noticed when BODY tag with an onload
  handler was written using document.write().

- Fixed relative URLs in CSS.

- Implemented CSS @media rules.

- RFE #1816542: Add Proxy Method. Added
  protected getProxy() method to
  SimpleUserAgentContext and 
  SimpleHtmlRendererContext.

- Fixed parser so that comments can end
  with more than two dashes, e.g. --->.

- Fixed so that blanks at the end of a
  line don't expand its width. This addresses
  some tables that force a horizontal 
  scrollbar.
  
- Fixed positioning of list bullets.
    
CssParser changes:

- Reversed order of lookup of property
  values in CSS declarations.
