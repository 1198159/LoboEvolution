Version 0.97
------------

- The Warrior browser has been renamed 'Lobo' 
  and significant refactoring of code has occurred.

- An extensions (plugins) API has been implemented.
  Look for the Extensions and Clientlets API 
  Documentation and the HOWTO page.  

- The following new browser features have been
  implemented: Open cloned or blank window, 
  back-to and forward-to lists, recent hosts
  list, page services such as Wayback Machine,
  a different type of bookmarks system (with
  tags and search), a separate directory menu, 
  a search engines feature, more preferences, 
  a new an improved download dialog, etc.

- The HTML engine and others are
  part of what is called the "primary extension".

- The XAMJ language effort is now inactive and 
  all code related to it has been moved to
  module XAMJ_Extension.
  
- ClientletContext is now a simplified inteface
  that has a ClientletFrame, which contains much
  of the prior functionality of ClientletContext.

- Incremental rendering implemented in HTML 
  clientlet.
  
- Implemented HTTP authentication dialog.

- Implemented META http-equiv elements, including
  charset and refresh.
    
- Implemented window title in the expected way.

- Worked around cookie date format issue. That
  allowed Amazon cart to be persist across runs.
  
- Fixed to allow cookie domains that don't start
  with a dot.

- Fixed user-agent string.

- Implemented POST with encoding 
  multipart/form-data.  
  
- Fixed redirect on POST.

- Implemented cookie path.

- Implemented global cookie handler that 
  applies to java.net.URL in general.

- Implemented new and improved download 
  window.

- Now processing Set-Cookie2 header.

- Implemented Max-Age cookie attribute.

Cobra changes:

- Note: For consistency with other project
  changes, all Cobra package names have been 
  renamed to have a prefix of "org.loboevolution." 
  instead of "org.xamjwg." 

- Note: Simplified FormInput so that values
  are of either type text or type file. 

- Note: No longer using HtmlParserContext
  interface, which is deprecated. Cookie
  methods used to implement document.cookie
  property have been moved to UserAgentContext.
  
- Note: No longer using context interface
  logging methods, for consistency. Logging
  should be controlled via java.util.logging
  only.
  
- Note: Deprecated HtmlRendererContext open()
  method that takes a String and replaced
  with one that takes a URL.
  
- Fixed issue with document background 
  color, introduced in 0.96.5.

- Fixed issue with weak references:
  Javascript object could be garbage
  collected even if its Java delegate
  was not. This resulted in new instances
  of Javascript proxies being created
  unnecessarily.

- Fixed so that CSS selectors with commas are
  processed properly.
  
- Implemented isScriptingEnabled() in
  UserAgentContext, including support for
  NOSCRIPT element. (Feature requested by
  a couple users).

- Fixed so that NOSCRIPT element is 
  processed during parsing, i.e. child
  nodes are not created at all.
  
- Fixed IFRAME functionality.

- Fixed absolute positioning implementation 
  (e.g. absolute positioned in absolute or
  fixed, but not in static).

- Fixed so that vertical alignment of table
  cell is not inherited by blocks.

- Implemented input types "file", "button"
  and "reset".
  
- Implemented BUTTON element.

- Fixed so that input type "image" still
  works when input name is missing.

- Fixed values of checkbox and radio
  inputs.

- Fixed so that "on" is used when radio
  or checkbox value attribute missing.
  
- Fixed so that document does not scroll
  back up while it's rendered.
  
- Implemented JavaScript security 
  controller. There is a new 
  UserAgentContext method named 
  getSecurityPolicy().
  
- Implemented UserAgentContext method
  getScriptingOptimizationLevel().

- Fixed rare IllegalStateException while
  rendering Amazon.com.
  
- Implemented deprecated document.<name>
  accessor.

- Implemented Window onload and onunload 
  event handlers.

- Fixed getDefaultValue() for Number hint.

- Fixed so that element's className property
  never returns null.

- Fixed so that setTimeout can be called with
  both a function and string arguments.  

- Fixed so that nested boxes aren't clipped
  when painted.

- Added reload() method to HtmlRendererContext
  and implemented Location.reload() with it.
  
- Fixed Location.search to include the question
  mark.
  
- Application of left/right margins/padding
  to inline elements.

- Fixed clicking through transparent boxes.
 
- Tweaked SimpleHtmlRendererContext so that
  file URLs are loaded ignoring the query
  string of the URL.
    
- Implemented Node's children property.

- Changed getTextContent() to return text
  content of node and its descendents, as
  specified by W3C.
  
- Implemented setting document.title as 
  document is loaded.
  
- Fixed issue with font-size as percent.

- Added HtmlPanel.createHtmlBlockPanel()
  and createFrameSetPanel() so that it's
  easier to extend the Cobra GUI.
  
- Added some support for style properties
  in tables, including absolute positioning.

- Fixed so that Text nodes created by
  setTextContent and other methods have 
  correct document and parent instances set.
  
- Tweaked CSS parser to allow properties
  that start with a dash (given that
  Wikipedia uses some).
