Version 0.91:
-------------

- Windows: Now adding .xamj file mapping during installation of
  Warrior. This allows Windows users to double-click .xamj files
  directly (works just as if it were an interpreted language,
  even though it's compiled -- we just need to add caching
  to make it fast.) Note, however, that clicking on .xamj links
  in Internet Explorer causes the .xamj file to be downloaded by IE,
  then passed to Warrior as a file, which will break relative URLs
  contained in the .xamj file. We might have to add another kind of
  file, such as .xamjlnk that contains the actual .xamj URL,
  to allow effective linking from IE and other browsers. If
  anyone knows a better way to achieve this, please email
  info AT xamjwg DOT org.
  
- Changed mime-type to application/x-xamj+xml.

- Fixed issue with split-box orientation.

- Fixed issue with tree-node sizing after icon added.

- Fixed issue with on-demand content loading not repainting sometimes.
	
- Added support for widget elements radio-button, check-box,
  toggle-button, radio-button-menu-item, check-box-menu-item,
  and button-group.

- Added support for document-disposition element below head,
  whose text value may be frame, window, or auto. The default is 
  frame, which causes the document to be rendered in the Warrior
  frame. Use window for standalone applications. The auto
  value means that it depends on how it's invoked.

- Warrior now runs in Mac OS X after fixing compiler bootclasspath.
  (Thanks to Carlos Solorzano for reporting the issue and helping test
  changes.)
	
- Added vbox and hbox abbreviations, like XUL.

- Added validation of element parent types.

- Changed tab attribute title to text.

- Fixed issue with on-click event in nested markup elements.

- Fixed issue with output stream not getting closed in download dialog.
