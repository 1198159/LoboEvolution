Version 0.96.3
--------------

- Implemented IFRAME (untested), SELECT, 
  OPTION, BIG, SMALL, FONT and FONTBASE
  elements.

- Implemented Location Javascript object.

- Implemented some HtmlRendererContext
  methods so that frame navigation works.
  JavaDoc FRAMESETs are now functional in
  the Cobra test tool.
  
- Fixed incremental rendering bug 
  introduced in 0.96.2: Tables, FRAMESETs 
  and aligned unsized images could 
  be partially rendered or not rendered
  depending on timing.
  
- Optimized background image painting. 
  A background image with repeat was
  enough to make the renderer do a lot
  of paint work on every repaint (and
  appear to "hang") as other images were 
  loaded.

- Fixed some parser bugs.

- Fixed rendering of vertical values 
  of image "align" attribute.
  
- Fixed font caching performance bug.

- Implemented means to register custom
  fonts (in class not currently in the
  API docs). Look for package org.xamjwg.gui,
  class FontFactory (a singleton), method
  registerFont. (UNTESTED)
