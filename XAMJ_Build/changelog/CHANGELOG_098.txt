Version 0.98
------------

- Note: NavigatorWindow.getAwtFrame() method
  has been replaced with getAwtWindow(). 
  Clientletcontext.getNavigatorFrame() is now
  getNavigatorFrame(). AbstractClientletContent
  changed a bit. Recommended API initialization
  has changed. There are other changes like 
  this aimed to improve the Lobo APIs.

- Implemented loading of Java and JavaFX
  source code in the browser. They are
  rendered much like HTML is.

- A new project logo was contributed by
  Oswaldo Danta. 

- Fixed some erroneous security restrictions 
  disallowing XMLHttpRequest. It also requires 
  send() now.

- Fixed alert and prompt dialogs so they
  don't show an "Applet Window" status message
  due to security restrictions.

- Added ClientletAccess class, which provides
  a utility method to obtain the ClientletContext
  of the current thread.

- Fixed BrowserPanel so that parent window
  title is not set automatically when the
  current document changes. There is a
  new getDocumentTitle() method. If there's
  a need to set the window title, this
  can be triggered off of a navigation event.
  
- Implemented transient (main memory) caching, 
  with APIs to add cache decoration objects, 
  both transient and persistent. In general,
  caching is more robust and efficient.
  
- Implemented addPrivilegedPermission() method
  in PlatformInit so that permissions otherwise
  missing from the security policy installed
  by init() for application code can be added.
  
- Added warning for case when no extensions
  are found. This is a setup error likely
  encountered by Lobo API users.  
  
- Fixed a deadlock that could occur after 
  opening the Console window.
  
- Added BrowserPanel.setCloseWindowOnDispose()
  that can be used to control whether the 
  parent window is closed when the BrowserPanel
  is disposed by a File/Exit action.

- Fixed so that clicking in browser launcher
  icon brings new window to front.

- Fixed copy/paste in error page.

- Upgraded installer to IzPack 3.11.0.

Cobra changes:

- Note: SimpleHttpRequest.openSync() has
  been removed, so it can no longer be
  overridden. Please override sendSync()
  instead.
  
- Note: Added structureInvalidated() method
  to DocumentNotificationListener.
  
- Note: Removed unused listNesting parameter
  from HtmlBlockPanel constructors.

- Fixed issue with hover effects (and
  other relayout triggers) causing inputs
  to lose focus.

- Fixed XMLHttpRequest to support send()
  method and to properly report readyState
  changes. The send() method now needs
  to be called after open(), which is
  how XMLHttpRequest is normally used
  in Mozilla browsers.

- Bug #1877923: HTMLSelectElementImpl 
  not calling super implementation. 
  Fixed this along with other selection
  issues in the SELECT element.

- Bug #1877254: visibility not supported.
  The CSS2 visibility property has been
  implemented. 

- RFE #1899831: Anchors support. 
  URL Refs/Anchors have been implemented.

- Optimized HTML collections, which is
  particularly relevant to those of 
  SELECT options.

- Reimplemented the way generic CSS properties
  such as padding, margin, border, background
  and font are handled. Setting them 
  causes sub-properties to get automatically
  set. (User guenze suggested this, and this
  is how CSS properties work in IE and Mozilla.)

- As a side-effect of the above, CSS properties
  border-top, border-left, border-bottom and
  border-right are now supported.
  
- Patch #1908245: Support for ProcessingInstructions 
  in Cobra. (Patch contributed by user vtec.)

- Fixed so that pseudo-elements ('hover' only
  at the moment) can be placed in any simple
  selector of a complex selector, e.g.
  div:hover span a { text-decoration: underline; }

- Fixed scrolling back to top on hover that
  occurred with some pages (wikipedia.org).

- Implemented scrolling methods in HtmlPanel,
  HtmlBlockPanel and SimpleHtmlRendererContext.

- Implemented method to retrieve the bounds
  of a DOM node from HtmlBlockPanel.

- Fixed so that anchors without an href
  attribute don't show as hyperlinks.
  
- Implemented window.getComputedStyle() method, 
  equivalent to Mozilla's. Note that elements
  still support the IE counterpart property, 
  currentStyle.

- Implemented document.defaultView property.

- Changed submitted TEXTAREA text values so
  they have lines ending in CR+LF. (SourceForge
  is particular about it.)

- Patch #1867969: ColorFactory missing 
  colornames. Added even more color 
  names. (Patch addendum contributed by 
  user guenze.)

- Changed to treat normally inline elements
  as blocks if they have an absolute or
  fixed position, or float positioning. 
  (This fixes SourceForge logo.)

- Fixed text-indent line width issue.

- Fixed issue with hover failing to trigger
  in vertically aligned table cells. (Cause
  of the bug brought to our attention by
  user vtec.)

- Bug #1875130: HeadlessException in 
  HtmlValues. (Fixed as suggested in
  bug report.)
  
- Bug #1870876: HeadlessException in 
  HtmlBlockPanel. (Fixed as suggested
  in bug report.) 
  
- Implemented isNavigationAsynchronous()
  method in SimpleHtmlRendererContext,
  so that there's a way to make navigation
  synchronous.

- Fixed SimpleHtmlRendererContext.submitForm()
  so that lowercase request methods work.

- Fixed SimpleHtmlRendererContext.submitForm()
  so that GET requests with form inputs 
  change the request URL as needed.

- Added SimpleHtmlRendererContext.createDocument()
  so that it can be overriden to provide a 
  specialized document on navigation or 
  form submission.

- Made HTMLDocumentImpl.loadImage() method
  protected. Allows providing an alternate
  mechanism to load images by extending
  the document class.

- Moved getInnerHTML to the NodeImpl level.
  This means the method may be invoked on
  a HTMLDocumentImpl instance to get the
  source of the entire document.

- Fixed an issue with the setting of an
  input element's value before the 
  GUI component is created.

- Fixed XMLHttpRequest to accept relative
  URLs.

- Made XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange
  handler execute in the request thread 
  as opposed to the GUI thread, so that
  the readyState value is consistent 
  with the state of the request.

- Added vendor and product properties to
  navigator object.

- Better determination of charset default 
  in SimpleHttpRequest and 
  SimpleHtmlRendererContext.

CssParser changes:

- Bug #1870765: does not read stylesheet 
  or maybe dynamic.
  Fixes StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
  in SACParserTokenManager.trimUrl.

- Fixed so that background property value 
  with a hex color followed by a URI works.
    
- Fixed so that MS values like 
  'alpha(opacity=50)' don't halt the
  parser.
  
- Allowing property names that start with
  an underscore.

- Fixed so that double-slash at the end of a 
  CSS document doesn't cause parser to fail.
  (SourceForge has apparently been testing
  double-slashes at the end of CSS documents.)
