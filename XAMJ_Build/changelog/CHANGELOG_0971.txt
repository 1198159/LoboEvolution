  in JRE 1.6.x.

- Fixed META refresh when the URL is relative.
  
- Changed manner in which absolute URLs are
  created given a relative URL, when the relative

  associations made by the installer.

Cobra changes:

- Rewrote float logic. This fixes a number
  of layout problems.

  this.location or window.location. (Thanks
  to Marc Guillemot of the HtmlUnit project
  for pointing out what the error was).

- Fixed exception that occured when a table
  element is not of type HTMLTableElementImpl,
  such as DIVs with display:table. (This 
  fixes Google search results page).

  that are descendents of absolutely positioned
  tables are shown.

- Implemented Javascript Event objects.
  
- Fixed an issue with tables becoming wider than
  they should, forcing a horizontal scrollbar.

  selectedIndex from a SELECT element before
  it's rendered.

  popup menu opens, albeit not in the usual
  location).

  on style change (specifically, changes to
