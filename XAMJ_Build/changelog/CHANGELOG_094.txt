Version 0.94:
-------------

- Did a significant refactoring of the API
  which involved decoupling clientlets from
  XAMJ. The main change is that XAMJ documents
  now have access to a local 'context' variable
  which contains members previously available
  via the 'document' variable. This can break
  some existing documents.
  
- Added method in platform API to add clientlet
  selectors (essentially new content type 
  handlers.)
  
- Added a way to set clientlet content using a
  lightweight AWT or Swing component.
