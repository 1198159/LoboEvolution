Version 0.98.4
--------------

- Note: Renamed NavigatorListener to 
  NavigatorErrorListener.  

- Updated JavaFX support so it's 1.0 
  compliant. 

- Added methods getContentObject() and 
  getCurrentMimeType() to FramePanel and
  BrowserPanel. getContentObject() should
  return HTMLDocumentImpl instances if HTML
  is showing.
  
- Added navigation listener, content 
  listener and response listener capabilities
  to FramePanel and BrowserPanel. Navigation
  events have a linkObject property that 
  should be of type HTMLElement for HTML
  clicks.

- Added navigation listeners to extensions. 

- Added connection pre- and post-processors
  to extensions. 
  
- Added a FramePanelFactory capability. 
  The factory that the browser uses to create
  FramePanel instances (e.g. for IFRAMEs)
  can be set with FramePanelFactorySource. 

- Fixed a security issue that prevented
  some windows from being opened programmatically.

- Implemented status URLs on link hover.

- Added insertProvider and removeProvider
  permissions to security policy for local
  code.

- Fixed a general issue with Javascript operations
  on windows that aren't yet open.
  
- Allowing cancellation of window open when
  progress window gets disposed of.
     
- Patch [ 2339649 ] Remove special 'U' character; 
  causes errors in some env's. Affects compilation
  of source code. (Thanks Derrick Rice - 
  derrick_rice).  

- Fixed error in unquoting of content-type
  charset. 

- Fixed charset of cached documents.

Cobra changes:

- Implemented CSS child (>) and sibling (+)
  selectors.

- Bug [ 2351217 ] Link target as frame identifier 
  no longer working. Name lookups of HTML 
  collections were not working, except when
  elements defined ID attributes instead of
  NAME attributes.

- Bug [ 2045717 ] Implement margin collapsing.  
  Paragraph spacing works based on margin
  collapsing. 
  
- Fixed layout issue with large right floats
  overflowing to the left and getting cut off.
  
- Note: Did a new refactoring of layout engine. 
  We're no longer using adjust() calls. An
  annoying issue with the layout getting clobbered,
  typically on mouse hover, has been addressed.
  
- Fixed nowrap layout issue affecting
  contiguous spans.

- Implemented known ways to set the BODY
  margin and scrolling.
  
- Implemented overflow-x and overflow-y. 
  (This is really a CSS3 feature).
  
- Implemented IFRAME frameborder, marginwidth
  and marginheight attributes. Additionally,
  overflow, overflow-x and overflow-y CSS
  properties now work with IFRAMEs.

- Implemented a box layout optimization.

- Implemented window.history. Cobra has 
  a blank implementation. Fully-functional 
  in Lobo. This happens to fix AdSense ads.

- Patch [ 2273159 ] Makes font fallback work 
  properly. This fixes an long-standing issue
  with some international fonts, particularly
  Chinese. (Thanks Trejkaz - trejkaz).
  
- Patch [ 2102369 ] BugFix in text-transform CSS 
  property handling. (Thanks Anonymous).
  
- Patch [ 2149273 ] Javascript implementation of 
  scrollTo(x,y), resizeTo(w,h). (Thanks Joerg 
  Ruethschilling - jr8).

- Patch [ 2208172 ] Eclipse Project Fix. 
  (Thanks Vinay Agarwal - vinaykagarwal).

- Patch [ 2183864 ] addHeader function added to 
  HTMLTableRowElementImpl. It's actually
  insertHeader. Non-standard method. (Thanks 
  Anonymous).

- Bug [ 2098924 ] font element ignores style 
  attribute. 
  
- Fixed font size "em" units used with certain
  elements like H1.

- setTimeout() timers no longer keep a 
  hard reference to Window instances.
  
- Fixed so that boolean attributes are true
  whenever the attribute is present, with
  any value.

- Fixed so that attributes with a blank value
  are not set to null.
  
- Fixed processing of innerText for SCRIPT,
  STYLE, and H elements.

- Added a 'text' property setter to OPTION.

- Added Window.open() method that only needs
  one parameter: the URL.
  
- Instead of setting default BODY padding,
  we set default BODY margin now: 8px.
  
- Implemented align="center" in tables.
