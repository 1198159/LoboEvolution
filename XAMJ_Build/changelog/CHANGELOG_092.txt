Version 0.92:
-------------

- Added mechanism to link from HTML. It consists of
  using a file with mime-type application/x-htln+xml 
  with a root element which has an href attribute. 
  (We will also be providing a mechanism thru our 
  website to make this easier.) This is passed to 
  Warrior as a file, which in turns opens the 
  target URL. (A XAMJ document over http runs 
  in a secure sandbox.)

- Added archive element, which goes below head.
  Each archive element specifies one JAR archive to 
  load.

- Now caching XAMJ and other content. Very noticeable
  the second time you launch Warrior.
  
- Now reusing JVM if running. Very noticeable if
  you launch Warrior or an app while another is 
  running.

- Added a standard I/O console, which may be accessed
  from the View menu and also from the Program Group.
  This works since the JVM is now shared.

- Added on-paint event to box/vbox/hbox which can 
  be used to paint on an AWT Graphics/Graphics2D object.

- Added href attribute to all button elements,
  including menu items.

- Added property attribute to on-property-change 
  element.

- Added param element for use with do-navigate.

- Added do-open action element to open content in a 
  new window. Similar to do-navigate.

- Added do-set action element to set element properties.
  May be used in conjunction with on-property-change.

- Fixed issues with .xamj file association title, icon 
  and mime type.

- Fixed getSelectedButton method in XButtonGroupElement.

- Added markup style attributes paragraphBreakBefore and
  lineBreakBefore. Fixed <h> tag accordingly.
  
- Added expression scriptlet of the form (%: expr %) which
  is short for (%= ((XElement) expr).getElementValue() %).
  Should be typically used with param and do-set.
  
- Changed default width/height of boxes to sum preferred
  width/height of children.
  
- Fixed so it cancels ongoing requests when nagivating to
  new page.
  
- Method XElement.getName changed to XElement.getNodeName.
