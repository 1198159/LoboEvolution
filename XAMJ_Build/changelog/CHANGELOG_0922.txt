Version 0.92.2 (Development Snapshot):
--------------------------------------

- Connection/proxy settings have been
  implemented. (Username/password must
  be set in the preferences dialog, because
  an interactive prompt has not been 
  implemented yet.)

- Added clientlet for text/plain. Using
  it for text/xml too for now.
  
- Improved attribute assignment generation
  by taking advantage of auto-boxing.

- Fixed bad window flickering issue introduced 
  in 0.92.1.
  
- Fixed another widget hierarchy
  enabling/disabling issue.
  
- Fixed so that URL of internal error page
  isn't shown to user (except for malformed
  URL errors.)

- Throwing MalformedURLException for URLs with
  blanks (Java doesn't do that by itself and
  servers give 505.)
