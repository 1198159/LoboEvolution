  jRegistryKey (LGPL).
  We use it to create file associations in Windows.
  Previously used for .xamj files. Currently not used
  just because we're no longer creating associations but
  should be used in the future. Binaries are 
  redistributed unmodified.

  We are using Rhino to process Javascript embedded in HTML 
  documents. Rhino binaries are redistributed unmodified.

  We use it to parse CSS code. Source code is modified, and
  available in CVS and in the Cobra distribution.

  a generic license that grants redistribution permission. Binaries
